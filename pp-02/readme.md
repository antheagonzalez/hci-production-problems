1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1070u0ktwjAldr6q9nE-Tf5LP9J
Your Rationale: I chose shades of darker red because red is bold color. Having bold colors could be beneficial to a company who wants their new console gaming platform to stand out. In addition, these shades of red help creative a competitive environment that many games have. I've noticed that a lot racing places like K1 speed have a lot of red around their facility and help pump up the racers.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52m0u0knLrkekCEjwuqrsn0uZie
Your Rationale: I chose shades of green and yellow because they remind me of the spring time and reflect what most healthy gardens look like during the spring time, nice, bold, and bright vegetation. In addition, spring time comes with warmer weather and makes people want to go outside, I feel like the these colors represent a nice outside vibe.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3030F0kp7saftCokyuFsynqvJiz
Your Rationale: I chose brighter shades of red, blue, and yellow/green since I feel that children will get more excited to a broad range of bright, playful colors. In addition, by using brighter shades the different options and function will stand out more to children.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13X0u0kxcfSotoSs2k7Ibb8So6a
Your Rationale: I chose dark shades of blue since many cybersecurity sites like NCLs tend to have dark and mysterious colors. In addition, when I think about cybersecurity, the first thing that pops into my head is a hacker sitting in a dark room, and I feel like the dark colors reflect that image perfectly.
