## ITMD 362, Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership/join page for Chicagoâ€™s Museum of Contemporary Art at
https://experience.mcachicago.org/donate/contribute1?ct=6 (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:

* Android Guidelines:
  https://developer.android.com/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2. an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:

Having the buttons on the form have a different colored text calls the user's attention that the buttons are interactive and have their own important function. (They take the user to the next step, complete the order, or cancel the order)

* HCI Guideline Two (https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/buttons/):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:

Having the buttons with verbs as the titles "that a button is interactive and says what happens when you tap it". In addition, by having a border around the buttons, this helps the buttons stand out to the user.

* HCI Guideline Three (https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/terminology/):
* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
